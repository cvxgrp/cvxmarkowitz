.. py:class:: _State

   The _State class defines a state object used to keep track of the current state of the portfolio.
   Attributes:

   prices: a pandas Series object containing the stock prices of the current portfolio state
   position: a pandas Series object containing the current holdings of the portfolio
   cash: the amount of cash available in the portfolio.

   By default, prices and position are set to None, while cash is set to 1 million.
   These attributes can be updated and accessed through setter and getter methods

   .. py:attribute:: prices
      :annotation: :pandas.Series

      

   .. py:attribute:: position
      :annotation: :pandas.Series

      

   .. py:attribute:: cash
      :annotation: :float = 1000000.0

      

   .. py:method:: value(self)
      :property:

      The value method computes the value of the portfolio at the current time,
      taking into account the current holdings and current stock prices.


      Returns:

      the value of the portfolio as a float. If the value cannot be computed due to missing position
      (they might be still None), zero is returned instead.

      The method is a decorator-based getter method, using the @property decorator to access
      the value attribute as if it were a method. The value of the portfolio is computed as the
      product of the current stock prices and the current holdings, summed together.
      Note that if the current position is missing, the multiplication will raise a TypeError.
      In this case, zero is returned as the value of the portfolio.


   .. py:method:: nav(self)
      :property:

      The nav method computes the net asset value (NAV) of the portfolio,
      which is the sum of the current value of the
      portfolio as determined by the value method,
      and the current amount of cash available in the portfolio.

      Returns:

      The net asset value of the portfolio as a float, computed as the sum of the current
      value of the portfolio and the cash available in the portfolio.
      The method is a decorator-based getter method using the @property decorator
      to access the NAV attribute as if it were a method.
      The NAV is computed as the sum of the current value (as computed by the value method)
      and the amount of cash available.


   .. py:method:: weights(self)
      :property:

      The weights method computes the weighting of each asset in the current portfolio
      as a fraction of the total portfolio value.

      Returns:

      a pandas series object containing the weighting of each asset as a fraction
      of the total portfolio value. If the positions are still missing, then a series of zeroes is returned.
      The method is a decorator-based getter method using the @property decorator to access
      the weights attribute as if it were a method. The weighting for each asset is computed
      as the product of the current position and the current stock prices,
      divided by the net asset value of the portfolio (as computed by the nav method).
      Note that this weighting represents the fraction of the portfolio value allocated to a particular asset.
      If the portfolio weighting cannot be computed due to missing positions,
      then a series of zeroes with the same size as the prices attribute is returned instead.


   .. py:method:: leverage(self)
      :property:

      The `leverage` method computes the leverage of the portfolio,
      which is the sum of the absolute values of the portfolio weights.

      Returns:
      - the portfolio leverage as a float, computed as the sum of the
      absolute values of the portfolio weights.

      The method is a decorator-based getter method using the
      `@property` decorator to access the leverage attribute
      as if it were a method. The portfolio leverage is computed as
      the sum of the absolute values of the portfolio weights,
      which represents the total exposure of the portfolio to multiple assets.


   .. py:method:: position_robust(self)
      :property:


   .. py:method:: update(self, position, model=None, **kwargs)

      The update method updates the current state of the portfolio with the new input position.
      It calculates the trades made based on the new and the previous position,
      updates the internal position and cash attributes,
      and applies any applicable trading costs according to model parameter.

      The method takes three input parameters:

      position: a pandas series object representing the new position of the portfolio.
      model: an optional trading cost model (e.g. slippage, fees) to be incorporated into the update.
      If None, no trading costs will be applied.
      **kwargs: additional keyword arguments to pass into the trading cost model.

      Returns:
      self: the _State instance with the updated position and cash.

      Updates:

      trades: the difference between positions in the old and new portfolio.
      position: the new position of the portfolio.
      cash: the new amount of cash in the portfolio after any trades and trading costs are applied.

      Note that the method does not return any value: instead,
      it updates the internal state of the _State instance.



.. py:function:: builder(prices, weights=None, market_cap=None, trade_volume=None, initial_cash=1000000.0, trading_cost_model=None, max_cap_fraction=None, min_cap_fraction=None, max_trade_fraction=None, min_trade_fraction=None)

   The builder function creates an instance of the _Builder class, which
   is used to construct a portfolio of assets. The function takes in a pandas
   DataFrame of historical prices for the assets in the portfolio, optional
   weights for each asset, an initial cash value, and a trading cost model.
   The function first asserts that the prices DataFrame has a monotonic
   increasing and unique index. It then creates a DataFrame of zeros to hold
   the number of shares of each asset owned at each time step. The function
   initializes a _Builder object with the stocks DataFrame, the prices
   DataFrame (forward-filled), the initial cash value, and the trading cost
   model. If weights are provided, they are set for each time step using
   set_weights method of the _Builder object. The final output is the
   constructed _Builder object.

   .. py:method:: __post_init__(self)

      The __post_init__ method is a special method of initialized instances
      of the _Builder class and is called after initialization.
      It sets the initial amount of cash in the portfolio to be equal to the input initial_cash parameter.

      The method takes no input parameter. It initializes the cash attribute in the internal
      _State object with the initial amount of cash in the portfolio, self.initial_cash.

      Note that this method is often used in Python classes for additional initialization routines
      that can only be performed after the object is fully initialized. __post_init__
      is called automatically after the object initialization.


   .. py:method:: index(self)
      :property:

      A property that returns the index of the portfolio,
      which is the time period for which the portfolio data is available.

      Returns: pd.Index: A pandas index representing the
      time period for which the portfolio data is available.

      Notes: The function extracts the index of the prices dataframe,
      which represents the time periods for which data is available for the portfolio.
      The resulting index will be a pandas index object
      with the same length as the number of rows in the prices dataframe.


   .. py:method:: assets(self)
      :property:

      A property that returns a list of the assets held by the portfolio.

      Returns: list: A list of the assets held by the portfolio.

      Notes: The function extracts the column names of the prices dataframe,
      which correspond to the assets held by the portfolio.
      The resulting list will contain the names of all assets
      held by the portfolio, without any duplicates.


   .. py:method:: set_weights(self, time, weights)

      Set the position via weights (e.g. fractions of the nav)

      :param time: time
      :param weights: series of weights


   .. py:method:: set_cashposition(self, time, cashposition)

      Set the position via cash positions (e.g. USD invested per asset)

      :param time: time
      :param cashposition: series of cash positions


   .. py:method:: set_position(self, time, position)

      Set the position via number of assets (e.g. number of stocks)

      :param time: time
      :param position: series of number of stocks


   .. py:method:: __iter__(self)

      The __iter__ method allows the object to be iterated over in a for loop,
      yielding time and the current state of the portfolio.
      The method yields a list of dates seen so far
      (excluding the first date) and returns a tuple
      containing the list of dates and the current portfolio state.

      Yield:

      interval: a pandas DatetimeIndex object containing the dates seen so far.

      state: the current state of the portfolio,
      taking into account the stock prices at each interval.


   .. py:method:: __setitem__(self, time, position)

      The method __setitem__ updates the stock data in the dataframe for a specific time index with the input position. It first checks that position is a valid input, meaning it is a pandas Series object and has its index within the assets of the dataframe.
      The method takes two input parameters:

      time: time index for which to update the stock data
      position: pandas series object containing the updated stock data

      Returns: None

      Updates:
      the stock data of the dataframe at the given time index with the input position
      the internal state of the portfolio with the updated position, taking into account the trading cost model

      Raises:
      AssertionError: if the input position is not a pandas Series object
      or its index is not a subset of the assets of the dataframe.


   .. py:method:: __getitem__(self, time)

      The __getitem__ method retrieves the stock data for a specific time in the dataframe.
      It returns the stock data for that time. The method takes one input parameter:

      time: the time index for which to retrieve the stock data
      Returns: stock data for the input time

      Note that the input time must be in the index of the dataframe, otherwise a KeyError will be raised.


   .. py:method:: build(self)

      A function that creates a new instance of the EquityPortfolio
      class based on the internal state of the Portfolio builder object.

      Returns: EquityPortfolio: A new instance of the EquityPortfolio class
      with the attributes (prices, stocks, initial_cash, trading_cost_model) as specified in the Portfolio builder.

      Notes: The function simply creates a new instance of the EquityPortfolio
      class with the attributes (prices, stocks, initial_cash, trading_cost_model) equal
      to the corresponding attributes in the Portfolio builder object.
      The resulting EquityPortfolio object will have the same state as the Portfolio builder from which it was built.
