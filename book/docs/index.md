## Poetry

We assume you share already the love for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). Once you have installed poetry you can perform

```bash
poetry install
```

to replicate the virtual environment we have defined in pyproject.toml.

## Kernel

We install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) within your new virtual environment. Executing

```bash
./create_kernel.sh
```

constructs a dedicated [Kernel](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) for the project.
